## Hi, I'm Daisie ðŸ‘¾

### I decided to switch careers and pursue my passion so here I am!

- ðŸ”­ I will be studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam starting in September '23!
- ðŸŒ± I started my programming journey with HTML/CSS. I am now learning <strong>Python</strong> and will start <strong>C++</strong> in parallel soon.  
- ðŸŽ® Discovering what happens behind the scenes in game development has led me to dive into <strong>3D modelling</strong>. I'm starting with an isometric lofi aesthetic bedroom in Blender!  
- ðŸ¤– I'll be updating this repository with mini simple projects and more advanced projects and coursework as I progress through my studies.  
- ðŸ’ƒ My other passion is <strong>dancing</strong>. I dance Semba (from Angola - I know you were thinking sAmba which is from Brasil), Konpa and Bachata. Feel free to find out more on my Instagram.
