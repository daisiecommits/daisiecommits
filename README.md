### Hi I'm Daisie ðŸ‘¾

## I decided to switch careers and pursue my passion so here I am!

- ðŸ”­ I will be studying Computer Science at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam starting in September '23!
- ðŸŒ± I started my programming journey with HTML/CSS. I am now learning Python and will start C++ in parallel soon.
- ðŸŽ® Never gamed before but ever since I found out what happens in the background of making a game - I've been hooked. I am starting to learn how to model (first an isometric lofi aesthetic bedroom) in Blender!
- ðŸ¤– I'll be updating this repository with mini simple projects and more advanced projects and coursework as I progress through my studies.
- ðŸ’ƒ My other passion is dancing. I dance Semba (from Angola - I know you were thinking sAmba which is from Brasil), Konpa and Bachata (find out more on my instagram).
