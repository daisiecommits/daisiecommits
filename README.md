## Hi I'm Daisie ðŸ‘¾

###I decided to switch careers and pursue my passion so here I am!

- ðŸ”­ I will be studying Computer Science at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam starting in September '23!
- ðŸŒ± I started my programming journey with HTML/CSS. I am now learning Python and will start C++ in parallel soon.
- ðŸŽ® Discovering what happens behind the scenes in game development has led me to dive into learning how to model, starting with an isometric lofi aesthetic bedroom in Blender! 
- ðŸ¤– I'll be updating this repository with mini simple projects and more advanced projects and coursework as I progress through my studies.
- ðŸ’ƒ My other passion is dancing. I dance Semba (from Angola - I know you were thinking sAmba which is from Brasil), Konpa and Bachata. Feel free to find out more on my Instagram.
