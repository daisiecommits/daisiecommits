## Hi, I'm Daisie ðŸ‘¾

### I decided to switch careers and pursue my passion so here I am!

- ðŸ”­ I will be studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam starting in September '23!
- ðŸŒ± I started my programming journey with PostgreSQL and HTML/CSS. I am now learning <strong>C++</strong> (and some <strong>Python</strong> in my free time).
- ðŸŽ® Discovering what happens behind the scenes in game development has led me to dive into <strong>3D modelling</strong>. I'm starting with an isometric bedroom in <strong>Blender</strong> and later on will try to train intelligent agents using <strong>Unity's ML-agents</strong> within the room. 
- ðŸ¤– I'll be updating this repository with mini simple projects and more advanced projects and coursework as I progress through my studies.  
- ðŸ’ƒ My other passion is <strong>dancing</strong>. I dance Semba (from Angola - I know you were thinking sAmba which is from Brasil), Konpa and Bachata.
